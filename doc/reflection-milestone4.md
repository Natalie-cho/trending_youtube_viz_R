## Milestone 4 Reflection

**Has it been easy to use your app?**

According to the feedback received from our peers and TAs, our app appears to be relatively easy to use, with many claiming that the app layout and interface is intuitive and simple to understand even prior to reading the documentation. Some have indicated that although the overall app is easy to use, the need to scroll to view the bottom two graphs is a small annoyance and that the implementation of tabs could help. Others have mentioned that they would prefer all graphs to be seen all at once (i.e., no tabs). Overall, users appear to agree that the app's user interface and experience are satisfactory.

**Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?**

Users agree that they like the app's simple layout which promotes the app's ease of usage and that the hovering functionality of the our graphs is a nice added touch. Some improvements for the app that users have mentioned are ensuring that all graphs are displayed within a single screen (i.e, no scrolling), creating graphs that explore the link between the highest performing trending videos and their specific stats (ex., posting time, number of views) and metrics (i.e., likes, dislikes, comments).

**Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?**

Adding in the hover functionality was a later thought and has added great functionality to our app (as mentioned by our users).

**Any items that your app lacks?**

-   As mentioned by a TA, the app loads slowly when rendered via shinyapps.io. We changed the amount of data that gets initially loaded so that startup is slightly improved. As the app loads quickly when loaded locally, we concluded that the lag time in rendering is most likely due to a slow server issue on Shinyapps' end
-   Our bubble chart could benefit from having a legend that describes clearly the meaning behind the sizing of the individual bubbles. At this stage, we were unable to implement this but this is definitely an area of further improvement
